				<p>JÃ¼rgen Norbert Klopp is a German professional football coach and former player who is the manager of Premier League club Liverpool. Often credited with popularising the football philosophy known as Gegenpressing, Klopp is regarded by many as one of the best managers in the world.</p>

				<p>As well receiving plaudits for his tactics, Klopp is also highly regarded as a motivator, with Liverpool FC striker Roberto Firmino saying "He motivates us in a different way every day".</p>

				<p>The importance of emotion is something Klopp has underlined throughout his managerial career, saying "Tactical things are so important, you cannot win without tactical things, but the emotion makes the difference". He believes that the players should embrace their emotions, describing how "[football is] the only sport where emotion has this big of an influence".</p>
